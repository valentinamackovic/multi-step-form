# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## About the project

This project is a multi-step form, built as part of a [challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/multistep-form-YVAnSdqQBJ) from the Frontend Mentor website.

Tailwind CSS was used for styling, with a focus on delivering a seamless user experience (UX) throughout the form, ensuring itâ€™s intuitive and easy to fill out.
